PDODblibBundle
--------------

This PDO DBLib bundle adds support for Microsoft SQL Server Doctrine 2. Take it with a grain of salt: Many of the Doctrine unit tests fail when using this driver. PHP's PDO_DBLIB driver does not support many of the features within doctrine. There is a patch in the PHP repo to add transaction and lastInsertId support, but this package has some minor work arounds.

This bundle requires the following:
* pdo_dblib
* FreeTDS

FreeTDS configuration
=====================

DBLib requires FreeTDS. We can't go into detail about configuring FreeTDS, but the connection configured should look something like following:

```
[mssql_freetds]
    host = 192.168.1.1
    port = 1433
    tds version = 8.0
    client charset = UTF-8
    text size = 20971520

```

Setting up bundle in Symfony
============================

In your Symfony2 project, modify your `config.yml` as follows to use the DBlib bundle and the server setup under FreeTDS:

```yml
# Doctrine Configuration
doctrine:
    dbal:
        driver_class:   PDODblibBundle\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDODblib\Driver
        host:           mssql_freetds

```

And in your `autoload.php` register the new bundle:
```php
$loader->registerNamespaces(array(
    'PDODblib'         => __DIR__ . '/../vendor/bundles',
));
```

Putting everything together
===========================

Getting everything together wasn't easy. You need to complete the following steps, checking each installation is successful by connecting with the appropriate tools:

* Install FreeTDS and configure a server connection 
    * *Verify* with ./tsql -S mssql_freetds -U yourusername -P yourpassword
    
* Install the PHP DBLib extension -- verify with PHP script containing 
    * *Verify* $pdo = new PDO('dblib:host=mssql_freetds;dbname=yourdb', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword');
    
* Install and configure the PDODblibBundle 
    * *Verify* Some kind of SQL against your database


FYI - PHP pdo_dblib patch
=========================

You can find a patch for some of the short-comings of pdo_dblib on SVN.

http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/ext/pdo_dblib/dblib_driver.c?view=log

See:
Revision 300647 - lastInsertId
Revision 300628 - transaction support

FYI - Doctrine Test Suite
=========================

Doctrine2's test suite does not allow you to add database drivers on the fly. If you want to test this package, modify `Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/DriverManager::$_driverMap`:

```php
final class DriverManager
{
    private static $_driverMap = array(
		/* ... snip ... */
        'pdo_dblib' => 'Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDODblib\Driver',
    );
}
```

FYI - Generating Entities from database
=======================================

It's possible, but not easy. Here's what I did:

- Map any non-compatible column types to string
- Hack the Doctrine core to skip any tables without primary keys
